# GNV fire recue data

This is some info from Gainesville, Florida's fire rescue teams
about when/what the call responses were. I thought it would be
interesting to see if there were some interesting correlations,
e.g. more alarms overnight.

In the end I didn't spot anything particularly prominent but I did get
a chance to try flot a bit more (it's pretty nice) and practice with
crossfilter some more.

This is a chance to play around with flot and crossfilter some.
